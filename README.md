# Stackoverflow-tag-prediction-deep-learning

## Problem Statement
Stack Overflow is a largest, most trusted online community for program developers to learn, share their
programming knowledge, and build their careers. It is something which every programmer uses one way,
or another.

It is very important and critical for Stack overflow to predict the accurate tags for the question posted
based on the title and description of the question posted as the posted question will be routed to
appropriate experts or set of people based on the tags to get the appropriate answer with quick
turnaround time. Any wrong tagging would drastically reduce the time taken to get the answer to the
questions. The wrongly tagged question can also be left unanswered at times. It can also suggest other
questions like the posted questions as helpful Q&A threads to bring good customer experience which is
again based on the predicted tags. Also, many times, users add wrong tags to their posted question
which also need to be taken care when predicting the accurate tag. Any inefficient tagging would cause a
mess and bring down the user traffic to the website. Therefore, efficient tag prediction is business
critical for Stack Overflow website.
